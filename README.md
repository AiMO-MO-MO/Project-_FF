# Fantasy Football

Fantasy Football is a popular math-based game that engages approximately 29.2 million (Statista Research) participants each year. This standard league involves assembling a roster of real-life athletes whose on-field performances determine the scoring of your team. Competing head-to-head against other league members each week, the goal is to compile the team with the most points to secure weekly victories. Win enough weeks to make the playoffs. Win the Playoffs to become Champion!

A Fantasy season begins on draft day, when teams take turns selecting players to fill out their roster. Drafting strategy is crucial as it lays the foundation for your season. A successful fantasy team requires a strategic balance of players.

Once teams are set, the real action begins. Teams face off against each other weekly, setting the lineup that they think will score the most points.

With the actions taken on field reflected in the scores, Fantasy players can spend endless time analyzing data to try and find an edge. Matchups, Injuries, most recent Performances, Bye Weeks, Weather and Location, Offensive and Defensive philosophies are just some of the factors that can impact what a player may score that week. This leads to endless opportunities to find an edge!

One of the great data gathering events for Football is the NFL Combine. It is a week-long invitation only showcase where college football players perform physical and mental test in front of NFL coaches, General Managers, and Scouts. 
Some of the events include: 40 yard dash, Bench Press, Vertical Jump, Broad Jump, 3 Cone Drill, Shuttle Run. 

Using the Combine data, we wanted to investigate if there was any correlation between Combine Performance and Fantasy Points scored.

The scatter plots compare the combine results with the total fantasy points scored over a players career. 
With the rÂ² at less than .00 for the charts. There is little correlation between Combine Results and fantasy points over a career.
