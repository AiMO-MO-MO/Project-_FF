Fantasy Football
Fantasy Football is a popular math-based game that engages approximately 29.2 million (Statista Research) participants each year. This standard league involves assembling a roster of real-life athletes whose on-field performances determine the scoring of your team. Competing head-to-head against other league members each week, the goal is to compile the team with the most points to secure weekly victories.

A Fantasy season begins on draft day, when teams take turns selecting players to fill out their rosters.

Drafting strategy is crucial as it lays the foundation for your season.
